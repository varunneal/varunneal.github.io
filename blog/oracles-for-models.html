    <h1>Oracles for Models</h1>
    <p>An LLM <a href="https://github.com/getasterisk/deepclaude?tab=readme-ov-file#why-r1--claude">doesn't care where its CoT knowledge came from</a>. Therefore, its CoT should be hacked to be as helpful as possible, even if the LLM itself cannot generate it.</p>
<p>Consider this deepseek-r1:14b CoT:  </p>

Okay, so I need to figure out how many &quot;rs&quot; are in the word &quot;strawberry.&quot; Hmm, let's start by  
spelling it out to make sure I have it right. S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Wait, no, that can't be right  
because when I think of &quot;strawberry,&quot; I know it has two r sounds, but maybe more letters.

Let me write it down properly: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y? No, wait, the correct spelling is actually  
S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So that's how it goes. Now, I'm trying to count the number of times the letter  
'r' appears in this word.

Looking at each letter one by one: S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, Y. Wait, so after the first R, there  
are two more Rs? Let me check again. After the initial R (the third letter), I think there's another  
R later on. So maybe that's it.

Wait, no, let me make sure. The word is S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So starting from the beginning: S, T,  
then R at position 3, then A, W, B, E, and then R again at position 8, followed by another R at  
position 9 before ending with Y.

So that means there are three Rs in &quot;strawberry.&quot; Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because when I  
think of it, the word has two 'r' sounds. Let me check a reliable source or maybe use another method  
to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The word is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So from  
position 3: R, then after E comes R again, and another R? Wait no, that's not correct because the  
word should be S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y, which actually has two Rs at the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with &quot;strawberry&quot; being spelled as S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Let me count  
again: 1 (R), then another R later on—so that's two Rs in total.  
&lt;/think&gt;

The word &quot;strawberry&quot; contains two 'r's.

**Answer:** There are 2 'rs' in &quot;strawberry.&quot;

<p>Instead of CoT, let's suppose we fine-tuned the LLM to use Oracles via tool-calling:  </p>
<pre><code>&lt;oracle&gt;  
I need to figure out how many &quot;rs&quot; are in the word &quot;strawberry.&quot; A reliable source tells me that there are &lt;python&gt;'strawberry'.count('r')&lt;/python&gt;  
</code></pre>
<p>Before the next token is generated, the <code>&lt;python&gt;</code> statement gets automatically executed, so the CoT finishes as:  </p>
<pre><code>&lt;oracle&gt;  
I need to figure out how many &quot;rs&quot; are in the word &quot;strawberry.&quot; A reliable source tells me that there are 3 &quot;r&quot;s in &quot;strawberry.&quot;  
&lt;/oracle&gt;
The word &quot;strawberry contains three 'r's.  
</code></pre>
<p>I think it is likely that such Oracle-like use of tool calling will be an emergent property of equipping current CoT SL with interpreters and other APIs. </p>
